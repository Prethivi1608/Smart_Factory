Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you
* collaborate with your team on computer vision projects
* collect & organize images
* understand and search unstructured image data
* annotate, and create datasets
* export, train, and deploy computer vision models
* use active learning to improve your dataset over time

The dataset includes 4097 images.
Adapter are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit within)
* Auto-contrast via histogram equalization

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 30 percent of the image
* Random shear of between -7째 to +7째 horizontally and -8째 to +8째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -14 and +14 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 4.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.68 percent of pixels
